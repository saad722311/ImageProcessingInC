# ImageProcessingInC
In this project, I have demonstrated my ability with the C programming language and its standard library by completing a C program that performs image processing operations on image files.

How to compile the program:

1. enter: gcc -o process process.c (to compile the file)
2. enter: ./process inputfilename.hsdec outputfilename (to save the outputfile after applying the filter to the input file image)
3. chmod +x hsconvert 
4. ./hsconvert -f PPM outputfilenmae filename.ppm (to see the applied filter to the image (MONO))
